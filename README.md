# IMZGen_Reloaded
Rewritten and Open Source version of IMZGen

#Compiling
Just load the solution into VS 2017 (might work in 2015?) and build. Compiled version in Releases.

#How to use
This tool is pretty straightforward. Create one or more IMDs by incrementing IMGD count, select which IMGD you want to edit (first one being 0), set the Length and Width, and click Save. Keep going until all IMGDs have been completely generated, then you can go to File > Save, then save it wherever. Inject to a bar using GovanifY's BAR editor.
